Hey Southeast Asia CS2 fans!

The hype is real! The Starladder Budapest Major stickers have finally dropped in Counter-Strike 2. Time to deck out your favourite weapons with some awesome new designs.

This release is a big deal because it's the first Major sticker collection in CS2, giving players a chance to support their favourite teams and players while personalizing their in-game look. Let's dive into what's new.

## 🤩 What's in the Sticker Collection?

You can expect stickers for all the teams that made it to the Budapest Major, including team logos and player autographs. There are also stickers celebrating the event itself.

## 🎨 Sticker Designs and Rarity

The stickers come in different rarities, like Holo, Foil, and Glitter, so you can find something that matches your style and budget. Rarer stickers will be more valuable on the Steam Community Market, so keep an eye out for those!

## 💰 Supporting Your Favorite Teams

Buying these stickers is a great way to directly support the teams competing in the Major. A portion of the proceeds from sticker sales goes directly to the teams and organizations involved. So get your wallets ready, and show some love for your favourite squads!

## 🗓️ Availability

The stickers are available for purchase in-game. They'll likely be around for a limited time, so don't wait too long to grab the ones you want. Get them while they're hot!

## ✨ Why This Matters

Major stickers are a huge part of the CS:GO/CS2 community. They let you show off your fandom, collect cool designs, and support the esports scene. This release is a fun way to celebrate the Budapest Major and get even more involved in the game we all love. Enjoy customizing your weapons, and good luck with your sticker pulls!
