# TI2025: No Battle Pass, but Fantasy and Predictions are Back!

Looks like Valve is sticking to its guns! Just like last year, there won't be a traditional Battle Pass for The International 2025. Instead, we're getting Fantasy and Predictions back to keep the competitive spirit alive.

This decision might be disappointing for some, especially those who enjoy the exclusive cosmetics and rewards usually tied to the Battle Pass. However, the return of Fantasy and Predictions offers a different kind of engagement, allowing fans to actively participate and test their Dota 2 knowledge.

## ü§î What's Happening?

Valve has decided to forego the large-scale Battle Pass model once again for TI2025. Instead of focusing on a system driven by cosmetic rewards and escalating levels, they are bringing back the classic features of Fantasy and Predictions. This approach aims to emphasize the core competitive aspect of The International.

## üèÜ Fantasy League is Back

## üîÆ Predictions: Test Your Knowledge

## üéÅ What About Rewards?

While there won't be a traditional Battle Pass with its plethora of cosmetics, Valve hasn't announced details on rewards for participating in Fantasy and Predictions yet.
