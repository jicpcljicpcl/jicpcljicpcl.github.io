The race is on for Tottenham Hotspur's talented teenager, Mikey Moore! After a promising breakthrough season, a loan move seems imminent, and Scottish powerhouse Rangers are reportedly leading the charge.

Under new management, Tottenham is allowing Moore to seek opportunities to gain valuable playing time.  While Championship clubs are also vying for his attention, Russell Martin's Rangers appear to be the frontrunners, according to _The Telegraph_.

Moore's omission from Tottenham's pre-season tour further fuels speculation that a deal is close.  Will the young midfielder find his stride in Scotland? All eyes are on this developing transfer saga.
