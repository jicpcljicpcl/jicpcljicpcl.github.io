Insania's perspective carries weight, coming from a seasoned pro and leader of a team consistently performing at a high level. His assessment highlights the respect Team Spirit commands in the Dota 2 scene. But what makes them so formidable?

## 🤔 Spirit's Dominance: A Closer Look

Team Spirit's victory at The International 2023 (TI12) cemented their status as a top team. Their gameplay, teamwork, and adaptability set them apart. While other teams have certainly improved, Spirit's core strength remains a significant factor.
