After a whirlwind £30 million move from Palmeiras to Manchester City, young defender Vitor Reis is reportedly seeking an exit. The Brazilian center-back, frustrated by limited playing time under Pep Guardiola, is considering a loan move this summer to secure more consistent minutes. With ambitions to represent Brazil in the 2026 World Cup, Reis is attracting interest from clubs like FC Porto and Bayer Leverkusen. Will City let him go, or can they find a way to integrate the promising talent into their squad? The clock is ticking on this potentially short-lived City career.
