A week of late drama and tactical surprises in Serie A has left Napoli reeling and Inter Milan sensing an opportunity.  Napoli's draw against Roma, coupled with Inter's late equalizer against AC Milan, has tightened the Scudetto race significantly.  This article dissects the key moments and analyzes the challenges facing Antonio Conte's Napoli.

**Napoli's Missed Opportunity**

Napoli's 1-1 draw against Roma felt like a punch to the gut for the Partenopei.  With AC Milan and Inter drawing earlier in the week, Napoli had a chance to extend their lead at the top of the table. However, Claudio Ranieri's Roma, despite fielding a weakened lineup, proved to be a tough opponent. Angelino's stunning volley cancelled out Leonardo Spinazzola's opener, leaving Napoli frustrated.

**Inter's Late Show**

Inter Milan salvaged a crucial point against AC Milan thanks to a dramatic 93rd-minute equalizer.  New signing Nicola Zalewski, on loan from Roma, provided the assist for Stefan De Vrij's goal. This late goal not only secured a point for Inter but also put pressure on Napoli.

**Roma's Resilient Performance**

Despite resting key players for their Coppa Italia clash, Roma put in a spirited performance against Napoli.  Ranieri's tactical changes, including the introduction of Alexis Saelemaekers, proved to be decisive. Angelino's stunning goal was a testament to Roma's determination and tactical flexibility.

**Conte's Challenges**

Antonio Conte faces a significant challenge in maintaining Napoli's title aspirations.  The sale of Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and the failure to secure key transfer targets have left Napoli short of firepower. The loan signing of Noah Okafor is unlikely to be enough to fuel a Scudetto challenge. Conte needs to find a way to extract the best from his squad if Napoli are to compete with Inter Milan.

**Looking Ahead**

With Inter Milan just three points behind Napoli and with a game in hand, the Scudetto race is wide open.  Napoli will be hoping that Inter stumble against Fiorentina as they look to get back to winning ways.  The title duel is far from over, and Conte will need to work his magic if Napoli are to emerge victorious.
