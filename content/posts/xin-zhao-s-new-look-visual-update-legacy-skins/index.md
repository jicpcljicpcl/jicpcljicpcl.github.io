# ‚ú® Xin Zhao Gets a Fresh Look in League of Legends! ‚ú®

**Xin Zhao**, the Seneschal of Demacia in *League of Legends*, is finally getting a much-needed visual update (VU)! This update will bring his look up to par with newer champions, while keeping his gameplay the same. Plus, some of his older, rarer skins are making a comeback!

This update is exciting news for long-time *League of Legends* players. Xin Zhao has been around for 15 years, and his original model was starting to show its age. The VU will refresh his appearance and animations, making him look more modern and dynamic.

## ü§© What's Changing?

Here's a breakdown of what's new with Xin Zhao:

-   **Visual Update:** Xin Zhao's base model, animations, and visuals are being completely overhauled.
-   **Legacy Skins Return:** Some of Xin Zhao's older and harder-to-find skins will be available again for a limited time.
-   **Price Adjustments:** Some older skins like Commando and Imperial Xin Zhao will see a price increase from 520 to 750 RP after patch 25.17.

## üóìÔ∏è When Can You See the Changes?

Xin Zhao's visual update and the return of legacy skins are expected to arrive with Patch 25.17. This patch will kick off season three, so players can look forward to these changes soon.

## üé≠ What About Xin Zhao's Story?

Xin Zhao and Yunara are already important characters in the lore of Ionia. With season three, LeBlanc and Atakhan will also play bigger roles. This visual update for Xin Zhao could mean he'll be featured in Riot's next animated series, especially if it takes place in Demacia or Ionia.

## üèÜ Looking Ahead

Last year, **Skarner** received a similar visual update, which completely transformed him. Xin Zhao's update is expected to have a similar impact, making him a more appealing and visually impressive champion to play. Get ready to see a brand new Xin Zhao on the Rift!
