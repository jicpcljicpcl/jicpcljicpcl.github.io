# 🏆 Who Will Be the Surprise Teams at TI25?

The International (TI), Dota 2's biggest tournament, is just around the corner! While everyone's eyes are on the top-ranked teams, history has shown that underdogs can rise to the occasion and make a deep run. Which teams could be this year's surprise contenders?
