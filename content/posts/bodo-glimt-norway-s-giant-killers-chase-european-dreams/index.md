## The Rise of a Northern Powerhouse üèÜ

Before, **Bodo/Glimt** wasn't a team expected to achieve great things. They come from a town of only 55,000 people and are one of the few teams playing football so far north.

But a historic cup win in 1975 changed everything. According to Orjan Heldal, the club‚Äôs commercial director, ‚ÄúBefore 1975, the people from Northern Norway were often discriminated against... When Bodo/Glimt won the cup that year, everything changed.‚Äù The team‚Äôs success brought pride and recognition to the region.

Even today, the players from that 1975 team meet at the stadium every day, showing the strong connection to the club's history.

## Turning Point: Believing in the Process üí™

The years around the COVID-19 pandemic were crucial for **Bodo/Glimt**. In 2018, they almost got relegated. But instead of firing the coach, Kjetil Knutsen, the club supported him. This decision paid off.

Frode Thomassen, Bodo/Glimt‚Äôs CEO, explained, ‚ÄúWhen COVID hit, everyone pumped the brakes. And we stepped on the gas." The team went to Spain to train and when the league restarted, they broke records!

Thomassen hopes their story will inspire other clubs. He believes success isn't just about money, but about hard work and dedication.

## More Than Just Goals üéØ

Even with dreams of Champions League qualification and league titles, **Bodo/Glimt** focuses on performance over specific goals.

Thomassen explains that instead of saying "We want to win," players focus on "We want to achieve a good performance." This simple shift is key to the club's culture. The goal is continuous improvement: "How can you do things better tomorrow than you did today?"

**Bodo/Glimt** is a unique club with a special culture, proving that anything is possible with hard work and a strong community.
