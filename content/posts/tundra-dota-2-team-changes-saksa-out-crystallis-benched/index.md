Hey Dota 2 fans! Big news from the Tundra Esports camp: they're switching things up with their roster. Let's dive into what's happening.

Tundra's recent performance hasn't been up to par, and the team has decided to make some changes to try and improve. This involves a player taking a break for personal reasons and another being moved to the substitute roster. These shifts are pretty significant, so let's see how they might affect the team.

## ü§ï Saksa Steps Away

Saksa, the team's position 4 support player, is taking a break from competitive Dota 2. Tundra announced this, citing personal reasons for Saksa's departure. It's unclear how long Saksa will be away, but the team wishes him well during his time off. A stand-in player will be needed to fill his role for upcoming tournaments.

## ü™ë Crystallis Benched

Crystallis, Tundra's carry player, has been moved to the bench. This means he's no longer part of the active lineup and will be available for transfer or loan to other teams. While he's a talented player, Tundra is looking for a different dynamic in their core lineup. This is a tough blow for Crystallis, who has been a key part of the team.
