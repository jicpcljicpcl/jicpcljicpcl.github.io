This is a significant move, showing that players are exploring different avenues within esports after their time in the spotlight. Let's take a closer look at what this means.

It's not uncommon for pro players to retire. The intense pressure, travel, and training can take a toll. While k0nfig hasn't explicitly stated his reasons, many players choose to retire to pursue other interests, spend more time with family, or avoid burnout. Becoming a player agent allows him to stay connected to the game he loves, but in a less demanding role.
