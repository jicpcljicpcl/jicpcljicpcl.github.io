## 🗺️ Explore Ancient Under the Moonlight

The biggest addition is the night-time version of the Ancient map. This isn't just a visual change; it affects how you play. The darker environment means visibility is reduced, requiring players to use sound and strategic positioning more effectively.

-   **Stealth**: Expect more sneaky plays and close-quarters combat.
-   **Lighting**: Pay attention to light sources; they can give away your position.
-   **Tactics**: Adapt your strategies to the new environment.

## 🎶 New Music Kit to Jam To

Music kits are a fun way to personalize your CS2 experience. This update includes a brand new kit with tracks to get you pumped up during matches.

-   **Atmosphere**: The new music aims to create a more immersive gaming experience.
-   **Personalization**: Equip the kit to replace the default music with something that fits your style.
