Amidst a flurry of last-minute negotiations and a completed medical, Liverpool has sensationally hijacked Arsenal's deal for Salford City's prodigious teenager, Will Wright.  Originally slated to join the Gunners for a reported £200k plus add-ons, Wright is now headed to Anfield in a dramatic transfer twist.  This article breaks down the key factors that led to Liverpool's surprise acquisition and what it means for the young striker's future.

Liverpool has beaten Arsenal to the signing of the Salford City teenager Will Wright in what is a shocking hijack.

_The Athletic_ previously reported that Arsenal agreed a deal to sign the 17-year-old in a deal worth around £200k plus add-ons in a deal that looked certain to happen as Wright wanted a move to North London.

However, Premier League champions Liverpool have hijacked the deal in what has been a fast moving story on Tuesday. The Reds will pay £200,000 for the 17-year-old, who is undergoing a medical and will join the club’s youth set-up ahead of the new season, where he is very likely to feature for the first team if he doesn’t go out on loan.

Wright has been a prolific scorer at youth level with Salford and made his first-team breakthrough as a 16-year-old. He scored more than 50 goals across age groups last season which explains why both Arsenal and Liverpool were desperate for his signature as Wright showed many top clubs what an exciting young talent he really is.

As reported by _The Athletic_ , Wright’s football education has largely taken place outside of the academy system, and Wright feels that a move to an elite environment is now the right next step in his development. Wright will join the likes of Trey Nyoni and Rio Ngumoha in a Liverpool academy that is shaping up to one of the best on the planet. The teenager is reportedly encouraged by Liverpool’s pathway from youth to first team which includes famous faces such as Conor Bradley, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Jarell Quansah and Curtis Jones.
