# CS2 Pro's Wild Demand: Helicopter Rides! üöÅ

Get this: a professional Counter-Strike 2 (CS2) player reportedly asked for monthly helicopter rides as part of their conditions for joining a team. Yes, you read that right! This unusual demand has stirred up quite a buzz in the esports community.

It seems some esports players have some very specific requirements these days! Let's dive into the details of this crazy story.

## ü§î The Unbelievable Request

Imagine being a team manager and hearing this. According to sources, the player wanted a helicopter available to them every month. The reason? Well, that's not entirely clear, but it definitely raises eyebrows. It's not every day you hear about esports pros needing airborne transport as part of their contracts!

## üí∞ The Cost Factor

Helicopter rides aren't cheap! This kind of perk would significantly increase the cost of signing the player. Teams usually consider things like salary, bonuses, and housing when making offers, but a monthly helicopter ride? That's a whole different level of luxury. It might be a deal-breaker for many organizations, especially smaller ones with tighter budgets.

## üó£Ô∏è Community Reactions

The esports community has been having a field day with this news. Some people are laughing, others are shaking their heads, and a few are even wondering if this is some kind of elaborate prank. Regardless, it has sparked a lot of discussion about player expectations and the growing professionalism (and perhaps extravagance) of esports. What are your thoughts?
