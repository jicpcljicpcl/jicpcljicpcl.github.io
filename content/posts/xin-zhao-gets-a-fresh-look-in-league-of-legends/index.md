# Xin Zhao's Visual Update: A New Look for a Classic Champion!

**Xin Zhao**, the loyal spearman of Demacia in *League of Legends*, is finally getting a much-needed visual makeover! His updated look brings him in line with newer champions while keeping his core gameplay the same. Plus, some of his older, rare skins are coming back for a limited time!

## ü§© Why the Update?

For 15 years, **Xin Zhao** has been a part of *League of Legends*. However, his original design started to look a bit outdated compared to the newer champions. This visual update aims to bring him up to par with the current standards of the game.

## ‚ú® What's Changing?

The update includes:

-   A complete visual refresh of **Xin Zhao's** base model.
-   Updated animations to make his movements smoother and more impactful.
-   Visual improvements to some of his older skins.

## üí∞ Legacy Skins Return!

During patches 25.17 and 25.18, some of **Xin Zhao's** rare, vaulted skins will be available again. This is a great chance for players to add these unique skins to their collection.

Also, some of his older skins, like Commando and Imperial **Xin Zhao**, will see a price increase from 520 RP to 750 RP. But don't worry, you can still buy them at the original price until Patch 25.17!

## üó∫Ô∏è Lore and Future

**Xin Zhao** plays a significant role in the lore of Ionia. With this visual update, he may also feature more prominently in future *League of Legends* stories and even potential animated shows.
