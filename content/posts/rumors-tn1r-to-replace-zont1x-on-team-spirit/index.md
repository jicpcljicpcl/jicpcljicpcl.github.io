# Possible Roster Change: **tN1R** May Join **Team Spirit**!

Big news in the Counter-Strike world! It's rumored that **Andrey "tN1R" Tatarinovich** might be leaving **HEROIC** to join **Team Spirit**. This change could mean **Myroslav "zont1x" Plakhotia** will be stepping down from the team.

This potential move has sparked discussions about team dynamics and future performance. Let's take a closer look at what this could mean.

## ü§î tN1R's Departure from HEROIC

**HEROIC** recently announced that **tN1R** will be leaving after the Esports World Cup in Riyadh. This confirms that a change is happening, but his next team wasn't announced directly.

-  **gr1ks** has also been moved to the bench, showing that HEROIC is making some big adjustments to their lineup.

Now, reports are suggesting that **Team Spirit** might be his next destination, which would be a significant shift in the competitive scene.

## ‚û°Ô∏è Will zont1x Make Way?

If the rumors are true, **tN1R** would be replacing **zont1x** on **Team Spirit**. zont1x has been with Spirit for a while, moving from their academy team to the main roster.

üèÜ He's even been part of some major wins, including:
- IEM Katowice 2024
- Perfect World Shanghai Major 2024
- IEM Cologne 2025

However, despite these achievements, some feel that **zont1x** hasn't always been consistent. **Team Spirit** has already brought in **Ivan "zweih" Gogin** to boost their firepower, so another change isn't totally unexpected. It's tough to stand out when you're playing alongside stars like **Danil "donk" Kryshkovets** and **Dmitry "sh1ro" Sokolov**.

## üí∞ A Risky Move for Team Spirit?

Bringing in **tN1R** isn't a guaranteed success. Although he's been a strong player for **HEROIC**, he plays a different role than **zont1x**.

‚û°Ô∏è **zont1x** is more of an "anchor" (defensive) player, while **tN1R** is a "rotator" (more flexible, moves around the map). This could mean someone on **Team Spirit** will need to adjust their play style.

It's also worth remembering that **tN1R's** performance dipped a bit when **HEROIC** tried to fit **Linus "nilo" Bergman** into the team. A similar situation could happen again.

However, with **zweih** and **Leonid "chopper" Vishnaykov** able to play as anchors, **tN1R** might have the space to shine. Plus, **zweih** is already handling some of the aggressive plays that **magixx** used to do.

üí∏ The reported price tag for **tN1R** is around $1.5 million, so this is a big investment for **Team Spirit**. Hopefully, it pays off!

## üîÑ Other Possible Transfers

There are also rumors about **FaZe Clan** and **Liquid** potentially swapping players, with **EliGE** and **Twistzz** possibly returning to their old teams. Stay tuned for more updates!
