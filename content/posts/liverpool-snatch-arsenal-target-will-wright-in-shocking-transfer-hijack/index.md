Liverpool have completed a stunning transfer coup, securing the signature of Salford City's highly-rated teenager, Will Wright, right under Arsenal's nose.  The deal, worth £200,000, sees the prolific young striker head to Anfield after Arsenal appeared to have already sealed the deal.

_The Athletic_ reported that Arsenal had a £200k plus add-ons deal in place for the 17-year-old, who was keen on a move to North London. However, Liverpool moved swiftly to hijack the transfer, with Wright currently undergoing a medical before joining their youth setup.

Wright's impressive goal-scoring record at youth level, including over 50 goals last season, made him a hot prospect. Despite his footballing education primarily occurring outside the academy system, Wright believes a move to an elite environment is crucial for his development. He will join other promising talents like Trey Nyoni and Rio Ngumoha at Liverpool's academy.

Liverpool's proven pathway from youth to the first team, exemplified by players like Conor Bradley, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Jarell Quansah, and Curtis Jones, reportedly played a key role in Wright's decision. The Reds have not only secured a promising young talent but also sent a clear message to their rivals about their ambition.
